Lets add some styling
- When we click on the CoderDojo girls logo the bird disappears and reappears right? But the logo doesn't
look like a button - so lets add some style

1. Add a different mouse/cursor style

- In style.css find the codergirl div and change the cursor
--  div#codergirl {
        cursor: pointer;
    }
NOTE: Some browsers don't  understand cursor: pointer so we can also add cursor: hand

2. Lets upload our websites to the internet :)

- First, we need to download FileZilla - [https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1
- Next you need to select Site Manager and enter your details (they are different for everybody). The details will be given to you by the class lead.
- Hostname: (This is your website address) ______.mycoderdojodcu.com
- Use FTP
- Username: dosa84_??????
- Password: __________
- Click Connect!
- Now you can find your website in the left hand side (Local Site) and drag the files over to the server (Remote Site).
- Now type the hostname in your web browser (Chrome/Firefox)
