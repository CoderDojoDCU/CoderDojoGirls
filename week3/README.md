# Week 3 November 22nd
This week we focused on a couple of new concepts.

1. Style Class
	- We added a style class to our paragraph html tags called `whiteBg`
	- Then we added that style class to our *style.css* file and learned that `class` in HTML is `.` in css.
2. We learned out to center a container on the page
	- We added `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto` to our `div#container` (our div with id of container).
	- We set the width of the container to a percentage (we can't center something taking up the whole screen can we?!)
3. We changed the background of the entire page to an image
	- We modified our `body {}` style to use `background-image: url('coder.png');`
	- We added *background-repeat* and experimented setting it to *no-repeat*, *repeat-x* or *repeat-y*.
