CoderDojoGirls
==============

- *beginnerHtmlCss:* CoderDojoGirls beginner html and css course as we first thought it.
- *flowerGame:* Similar to CoderDojo balloon game but aimed at younger girls
- *pianoGame:* Modification of the piano came developed by Catrina Carrigan in CoderDojoDCU
- *mobileWeb:* (November 2014) A mobile web site that teaches basic html and style and is suitable for uploading to PhoneGap.

DISCLAIMER:
Teaching notes are missing in a lot of cases. The finished code for a week often has mistakes in it (some on purpose!).
All code was uploaded as we finished a class and there may be gaps between weeks as Instructors swapped around.
